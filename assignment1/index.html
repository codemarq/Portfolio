Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby it'd be a good chance to rub off on her.

				<p>Artoo expresses his relief, also. How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark. Thanks to you. That's two you owe me, junior. Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer. I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield. That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.</p>
